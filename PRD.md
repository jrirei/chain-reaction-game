- ✅ Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase following React best practices
- ✅ Smooth animations and intuitive user interface
- ✅ Multi-player support (2-4 players) with elimination mechanics

## 2. Game Rules & Mechanics

### 2.1 Core Rules ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
1. **Grid**: 6×9 grid of cells (54 total cells)
2. **Players**: 2-4 players with full elimination support
3. **Turns**: Players take turns placing orbs in empty cells or their own cells
4. **Critical Mass**: 
   - Corner cells: 2 orbs
   - Edge cells: 3 orbs  
   - Interior cells: 4 orbs
5. **Explosion**: When critical mass is reached, cell explodes:
   - All orbs disappear from the cell
   - Adjacent cells (up/down/left/right) each receive one orb
   - Orbs change to the current player's color
6. **Chain Reactions**: Complex multi-step chain reactions fully supported with complete animation
7. **Victory**: Last player with orbs on the board wins
8. **Elimination**: Automatic player elimination with proper turn progression and identity preservation
