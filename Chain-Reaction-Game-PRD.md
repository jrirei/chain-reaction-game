## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Product Description
A fully-featured web-based implementation of the classic "Chain Reaction" game using React 18+ and TypeScript. Players (2-4) take turns placing orbs on a grid, triggering explosive chain reactions when cells reach critical mass. Features comprehensive multi-player support, smooth animations, and production-ready code quality.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Casual gamers looking for strategic gameplay
- Players familiar with the original Chain Reaction game
- Users who enjoy turn-based strategy games
- Multi-player gaming groups (2-4 players)

### 1.3 Success Criteria ✅ **ACHIEVED**
- ✅ Functional game with complete Chain Reaction mechanics
- ✅ Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase following React best practices
- ✅ Smooth animations and intuitive user interface
- ✅ Multi-player support (2-4 players) with elimination mechanics
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (41 tests)
- ✅ Production-ready build system

## 2. Game Rules & Mechanics

### 2.1 Core Rules ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
1. **Grid**: 6×9 grid of cells (54 total cells)
2. **Players**: 2-4 players with full elimination support
3. **Turns**: Players take turns placing orbs in empty cells or their own cells
4. **Critical Mass**: 
   - Corner cells: 2 orbs
   - Edge cells: 3 orbs  
   - Interior cells: 4 orbs
5. **Explosion**: When critical mass is reached, cell explodes:
   - All orbs disappear from the cell
   - Adjacent cells (up/down/left/right) each receive one orb
   - Orbs change to the current player's color
6. **Chain Reactions**: Complex multi-step chain reactions fully supported
7. **Victory**: Last player with orbs on the board wins
8. **Elimination**: Automatic player elimination with proper turn progression
