# Chain Reaction Game - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Product Description
A web-based implementation of the classic "Chain Reaction" game using React. Players take turns placing orbs on a grid, and when a cell reaches critical mass, it explodes and spreads orbs to adjacent cells, potentially triggering chain reactions.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Casual gamers looking for strategic gameplay
- Players familiar with the original Chain Reaction game
- Users who enjoy turn-based strategy games

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Functional game with complete Chain Reaction mechanics
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Clean, maintainable codebase following React best practices
- Smooth animations and intuitive user interface

## 2. Game Rules & Mechanics

### 2.1 Core Rules
1. **Grid**: 9x6 grid of cells (adjustable in settings)
2. **Players**: 2-8 players (default: 2 players)
3. **Turns**: Players take turns placing orbs in empty cells or their own cells
4. **Critical Mass**: 
   - Corner cells: 2 orbs
   - Edge cells: 3 orbs  
   - Interior cells: 4 orbs
5. **Explosion**: When critical mass is reached, cell explodes:
   - All orbs disappear from the cell
   - Adjacent cells (up/down/left/right) each receive one orb
   - Orbs change to the current player's color
6. **Chain Reactions**: Explosions can trigger more explosions
7. **Victory**: Last player with orbs on the board wins
8. **Elimination**: Player is eliminated when they have no orbs left

### 2.2 Game Flow
1. Game setup (select players, grid size)
2. Player turn cycle
3. Orb placement validation
4. Explosion calculation and animation
5. Win condition check
6. Game over handling
